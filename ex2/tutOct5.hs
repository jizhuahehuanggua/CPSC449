    proof the data type and

    f(k) , f(k+1) 
    xï¼Œ (x:xs)

we want to show:
    sum(xs ++ ys) = sum xs + sum ys 

proof:
    we need to prove two goals:
        1. for base case, we have to prove sum ([] ++ ys) = sum[] + sum ys (base)
        2. for induction step, we have to prove sum ((x:xs) ++ ys) = sum (x:xs) ++ sum ys (ind)
            on the assumption that sum(xs ++ ys) = sum xs + sum ys (hyp)

Base:
    
LHR : sum([] ++ ys)
      = sum ys              by ++1 
      

RHS : sum[] + sum ys 
      = sum ys              by s1
    
LHS = RHS.

induction:

LHS : sum((x:xs) ++ ys)
      = sum (x : (xs ++ ys))    by ++2
      = x + sum (xs ++ ys)      by s2 
      = x + sum xs + sum ys     by hyp 

RHS : sum (x:xs) ++ sum ys
      = x + sum xs + sum ys     by s2 

LHS = RHS. 



we want to show:
xs ++ [] = xs

proof:
    we need to prove two goals:
        1. for base case, we have to prove [] ++ [] = [] (base)
        2. for induction step, we have to prove sum (x:xs) ++ [] = (x:xs) (ind)
            on the assumption that sum(xs ++ ys) = sum xs + sum ys (hyp)
